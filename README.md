## üé® Design System

### Theme Variables

The application uses a comprehensive theme system with CSS custom properties that automatically adapt to light and dark modes:

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, accent, muted, destructive
- **Typography**: Consistent font scales and weights
- **Spacing**: Systematic spacing scale
- **Borders**: Consistent border radius and styling
- **Shadows**: Layered shadow system for depth

### Component Styling

- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Subtle gradients for visual depth
- **Backdrop Blur**: Modern frosted glass effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint system
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions

## üì± Responsive Features

### Mobile Optimizations

- **Horizontal Timeline Scroll**: Timeline adapts to small screens with custom scrollbar
- **Stacked Layout**: Card layouts stack vertically on mobile
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets and gesture support
- **Bottom Navigation**: Theme toggle positioned for thumb accessibility

### Desktop Enhancements

- **Grid Layouts**: Multi-column skip card displays
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive states for better UX
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support

## üîß API Integration

The application integrates with external APIs for real-time data:

```typescript
// Skip data structure
interface SkipData {
  id: number;
  size: number;
  hire_period_days: number;
  price_before_vat: number;
  vat: number;
  postcode: string;
  area: string;
  allowed_on_road: boolean;
  allows_heavy_waste: boolean;
  // ... additional properties
}
```

**Endpoint**: `https://app.wewantwaste.co.uk/api/skips/by-location`

- Query parameters: `postcode`, `area`
- Response: Array of available skip options with pricing

## üéØ Key Components

### SkipChooser

Main interface component that:

- Fetches and displays available skips
- Handles skip selection and drawer opening
- Manages application state

### Skip Card

- Skip size and pricing information
- Service area and restrictions
- Expandable details section
- Booking action buttons

### Drawer Component

Modal component for skip details:

- Responsive design with mobile optimization
- Gradient styling matching theme
- Action buttons for booking flow
- Toast notification integration

### Timeline Component

Service process indicator:

- Visual progress representation
- Responsive icon-only display on mobile

## üîÑ State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management:

- **useState**: Component-level state for UI interactions
- **useEffect**: Data fetching and side effects
- **Context API**: Theme management across components

## üéØ Development Approach

### Methodology

**Technology Decisions**

- **React + TypeScript**: Provides compile-time error checking and IntelliSense for better code quality and fewer runtime bugs
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Enables rapid prototyping with utility-first CSS while maintaining accessible, pre-tested component primitives
- **Vite**: Delivers instant hot module replacement and optimized builds, significantly faster than traditional bundlers
- **Mobile-first approach**: Ensures optimal performance on mobile devices where 70%+ of service industry users browse

**Development Phases**

1. **Architecture**: Built modular component structure with clear data flow, TypeScript interfaces for API contracts, and separation of concerns
2. **Theme System**: Implemented CSS custom properties for dynamic theming with React Context for global state management across components
3. **Responsive Design**: Created fluid layouts that adapt gracefully, custom horizontal scrolling for timeline, and fixed viewport overflow issues
4. **UX Enhancements**: Added contextual toast notifications, smooth micro-interactions, and comprehensive accessibility features for all users

### Key Challenges & Solutions

**Mobile Responsiveness**

- _Problem_: Timeline components caused horizontal overflow on small screens, theme toggle button was partially hidden
- _Solution_: Implemented horizontal scrolling with hidden scrollbars for timeline, repositioned toggle outside overflow containers with proper z-indexing
- _Result_: Seamless mobile experience with no layout shifts or hidden UI elements

**Theme Consistency**

- _Problem_: Toast notifications used default styling that clashed with the application's design system
- _Solution_: Created comprehensive CSS custom properties system that automatically adapts toast styling to match current theme
- _Result_: Unified visual language across all components with smooth light/dark mode transitions

**Code Quality Standards**

- **Component Architecture**: Single-responsibility components with props-based composition for maximum reusability
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration catches potential errors at compile time and provides autocomplete for API responses
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders with proper React keys, CSS transforms for animations, and lazy loading where applicable
- **Testing**: Cross-device validation on mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) with real device testing via ngrok
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

**Key Insights**

- **Mobile-first development** streamlined responsive design by starting with mobile layouts first, making it easier to progressively enhance for larger screens
- **CSS custom properties** provided unprecedented theme flexibility compared to traditional SCSS variables
- **Component composition** created a maintainable codebase that's easier to test and extend than monolithic components

This systematic approach prioritized user experience and code maintainability while delivering a production-ready web application for the skip rental industry.
